v_6Yn2U58qxPs	Two men are putting on gear beside a cliff	0.0	27.94	214.95	13.0	so a lot of people they think that rock climbing is going to be mostly upper body when really it's all about leg work and footwork and it's all about balance as well so if you're standing like this and you're going to stand on one leg what do you have to do Oh incidentally	val_2	215
v_6Yn2U58qxPs	One of the men is talking about the process	41.91	128.97	214.95	13.0	in rock climbing so while I climb I'm always thinking about my feet in the hood right here stand up like this copy that you're coming to the bottom and I just shift my weight over that foot also times take six big steps take a big step like this yeah it gets you kind of out of balance it's going to feel it's gonna be difficult I'm press off of that but if I put my foot right here to go baby steps like this this move up so you notice how I keep sitting there way right over that's pretty much the just of it right there there's also certain situations where hey rock you could traverse like this oh yeah you can just kind of move your feet this kind of sidestep be some situations who actually put cross through do this number it's all about definite wiener yeah so you notice that you have like some very small edges here in there and the part of your shoe that you want to use the most is going to be this part right here can be this kind of area on your shoes that's not your strongest part because your big toe these shoes are designed to put that big toe right on that spot and it's also kind of down turn you know circular control that puts the maximum amount of force on the edge you're going to put your shoes on if your shoes are too big	val_2	216
v_6Yn2U58qxPs	They then demonstrate rock climbing	148.31	214.95	214.95	13.0	smearing and it's basically using the balls of your feet in maximum friction and pressure against the wall it's also about body position as well so they have a really good handle right here kind of work your feet up like this but you must keep my body out like that my balls on my feet stick a little bit on the rock like that that's that maximum pressure and friction like the book my lips are get pulled and then I can start moving up and you notice that this is a slab so also keep them in the body upright like this and people first came in the climbing could have a tendency of putting the wall like this you do that you can't see your feet and your body out like this I can receive exactly I'm going to go you notice they keep my heels down and out just the the strongest part is put is using that I'm able to start move it up from there that's kind of the fundamentals	val_2	217

v_furUOKw0Qzs	He loosens the bolts and positions the jack, removes the tire and replaces it with a new one	69.49	105.95	137.6	1.0	wheels to help prevent the first part of the process is to loosen off each of the locking devices whether it's wheel nut or bolt only about half a turn or report of the turn we then position or jack underneath the jacking point and your handbook will show you where that is we will then lift the vehicle up using the jack until the wheel is about two or three centimetres clear of the ground linger than that we'll use our wheel brace to begin and will completely remove all the wheel nuts or bolts and then we can take the wheel away from the car the space st. mark we can refit in exactly the same place that the last wheel is come from and we can refit any wheel bolts or nuts just do not hand tight and then nipping them up using the wheel brace will lower the car down of	val_2	686
v_furUOKw0Qzs	Then he lowers the car and tightens the new bolts, then removes the jack and talks for a bit more	106.64	132.79	137.6	1.0	tight and then nipping them up using the wheel brace will lower the car down of the jack just to the point where the tire has just started to contact the ground no more than that stop the wheel from rotating and then we can fully tighten each of the wheel nuts in turn using the wheel brace lastly you can remove the jack and then you're able to get on your way one thing to remember is space overs and tire world are only intended as a temporary repair so if you've had cause to remove the whale juice of hunch now you need to get that sword out as soon as possible	val_2	687

v_3La7NPOBVN8	At the end she puts a hair tie on it, pulls the braid a bit and smiles	186.06	205.59	205.59	13.0	to tie it off with my hair tie I just use Brown because it blends in with my hair and I like to leave a little bit of a section because I think it makes it look more like a fish which is kind of funny but that's all that there is to it and there's your fishtail braid and then if you want to to make it look a little bit more Messier you can just pull out the strands a little bit I hope that this demonstration helps you guys making your own fishtail braids and I'll see you in my next video thanks guys	val_2	738

v_OYAyb_Ire24	She applies foundation to her skin	25.21	86.45	180.09	10.0	on and as a sixth grader I thought it was cool to put on so I put on the littlest amount and that is the sixth grade look for seventh grade makeup I powdered my face but instead of sweeping it like usual I padded it into my skinks this is the only face makeup you'll be using and if you're oily it's easier for the powder to absorb if you pat it in and then I used a concealer use any concealer you want I just didn't happen to have a drugstore makeup concealer at this time so I'm just blending that in as usual and when I think of seventh-graders I think of eyeliners so that's the time people usually start experimenting with eyeliner so I put it on my top lash line and my waterline I'm going to this is a high end eyeliner obviously you could get a drugstore eyeliner this is just the only pencil eyeliner I had so sorry about that June's we put on eyeliner it makes sense to put on a little bit more mascara than we did in the sixth grade look because it's kind of odd when you don't have	val_2	993
v_OYAyb_Ire24	She then applies lipstick and eye makeup	91.85	180.09	180.09	10.0	eyeliner on which is my personal preference and then I switched my lip color to a light pink color which is a baby lips and pink punched and that is a completed seventh-grade look on to eighth grade I decided to apply a BB cream because in eighth grade is when I started wearing BB cream because it's a little bit lighter and then eighth grade your skin starts to break out a little more because we've turned into a teenager you know that whole thing so I just applied a light BB cream all over my face and then I lightly put a powder over it not for coverage just to set the BB cream in place and now I'm gonna apply some blush because I think if you put on BB cream blush is kind of essential to bring color back into your face and so I took off my eye liner from the seventh grade look and now I'm applying a too cool what's it called where's those called color tattoos I'm flying out on both my eyes as a base and now I'm using the silk teddy eyeshadow from the Too Faced natural eye palette over that as they all over the lid color now I'm using the colors that fresco also from the palette - deep brown i really suggest this palette if you're getting into eyeshadow it's less expensive than the Naked palette and it has just as many great colors so i really suggest this palette and i love it and that is the completed oh wait no just kidding now i'm putting on a go nude color whisper and that is the completed look then i hope you guys enjoyed this and i'll see you next time	val_2	994

v_VaT3qsoHPQ8	They mix ingredients into a large clear bowl	11.14	89.15	159.2	13.0	and crunchiness on the outside so let's get started first go ahead and measure our 2 cups of all-purpose flour and then add this to a small bowl then add an a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda along with a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and then whisk everything together now you need a cup of brown sugar make sure this is packed of course and add this to a separate bowl then add an 1/2 cup of white sugar and you also need 3/4 cup of butter now in this recipe instead of using room-temperature butter are you going to be using melted butter this is going to make your cookies a lot chewier so go ahead and add the seer bowl and then you're just going to mix this together with the wooden spoon one of the reasons why I really like this recipe is that you don't need a stand mixer for it now I'm going to crack in an A and you also need an egg yolk for extra richness and then you need a tablespoon of vanilla extract then just give us a stir now go ahead and add in your dry ingredients and mix everything together this can get a little tricky to do with the spoon so eventually I switched to using my hands now I got these semi-sweet chocolate chunks from Trader Joe's and I really like these because	val_2	1194

v_vvvjTjsXbzE	She talks then pours two shots into the bowl	64.1	84.42	156.32999999999998	11.0	to learn this method is to actually practice by using a jigger so here I'm going to show you I'm just going to count for me typically a four count equals one out so one two three four and for the other side three count one two three so then what you can do to test	val_2	1211

v_A3a6MNgab0c	A young man is standing in a room holding an archery bow in his hand and talking about the equipment	0.0	26.31	95.67	4.0	hi this is drew with Jake's archery in Utah I'm going to teach you how to use stabilizers on your bow there's two different scenarios in which you'll use the stabilizer one is on a target setup like this the other is on your hunting bow the stabilizers have two purposes one is they help the aiming the second thing they do is they actually take up some vibration in the bowl so the bow feels smoother when you shoot it in a target scenario it's a lot of trial and error you have to get a couple different stabilizers change the way move it	val_2	1489
v_A3a6MNgab0c	Shortly after,he removes his hand from the black stick and demonstrates its use making sure to hold it up with his arms at a ninety degree angle	26.79	71.27	95.67	4.0	you have to get a couple different stabilizers change the way move it around front to back side to side to really get the bow to aim how you want to aim in a hunting bow it's not quite so critical you're more after the dampening effect if the stabilizer creates so you just want to pick a stabilizer that feels best here you can pretty much try those at any local Pro Shop so on this bow I've got two different stabilizers the one on the front and the one on the side and the one on the front again is just a balance the one on the side does the same thing but it's more specific in that it offsets the weight from your sight and your wrist so basically gives you a better level from left to right to make sure your level bubble stays level through the shot	val_2	1490
v_A3a6MNgab0c	Finally,the guy takes a break from talking and releases the bow and aims at the target	71.75	95.67	95.67	4.0	sure your level bubble stays level through the shot this one here as you can see is a lot shorter again it's more just to dampen the bow and not so much for the aiming purpose in a hunting setup I'm drew Hartman and that's how you use stabilizers on your compound bow	val_2	1491

v_gLfvk2SSj1c	A young man wearing a green shirt is talking about the techniques involved in rock climbing	0.0	138.02	138.02	4.0	hi my name is Adam barzak I've been teaching rock climbing for about two and a half years now I'm a certified instructor by the American mountain guides Association and today I'm here to introduce you into the world of rock climbing rock climbing is for all ages I've seen kids as young as two-year-olds 265 over rock climbing why because it's an enjoyable sport it's not only a physical challenge but also when you're trying to figure out how to climb things it's a mental puzzle that you're kind of putting together in your head and so once you figure out the moves and try to translate it to your body it's really satisfying once you actually complete the movements and reach the top of the wall right off the bat the first thing you're going to notice when you're rock climbing is that your hands are going to get really weak that's just because your forearm muscles usually aren't strong enough to just hold on to things after your forearms get strong enough it becomes a full body workout your back your core muscle stabilization and just overall flexibility are great improvements to rock climbing so let's first talk about how indoor climbing can translate to outdoor climbing not only does it translate through different the similar body techniques and movements but also the rating system now the rating system is what tells you the difficulty of this particular climb the rating system always works with a 5 in the beginning because it's your 70 decimal rating system and what it means is this is class 5 type of rock feature so class 1 is like a hiking trail it goes 1 2 3 4 5 what class 5 means is that you need ropes and protection to climb otherwise a fall is considered fatal the class 5 rating system starts at five point zero and then increases a number as it increases in difficulty back in the day Yosemite Decimal rating system was limited to 5.9 they quickly found that a 5 9 was a very limiting number in terms of Radiance systems so the Yosemite Decimal System was broken when they moved it to 5 10 a now they put little letters after the number to indicate the difficulty so it goes ABCD then rolls over to five and ABCD and up and up that way	val_2	1505

v_JE50XTpCN78	A woman explains how to polish the fingernails	5.48	93.09	219.03	13.0	before you soak your nails always cut your cute your nails first you don't want your nails to absorb the water get too soft and then as you're cutting and then shaping them they'll start to fray like jeans think about the shape that you want first do you want something that's really pointy or do you want something that's an active length and it's going to allow you to do everything that you want to do during the day I always recommend squared with rounded edges because it doesn't snag your pantyhose it doesn't snag your clothes and if you were to hit your nail up against the wall or anything you wouldn't feel it as much because the corners actually help absorb the shock which is kind of cool thinking about how your nails can do all these things for you I also like the oval which is the nail is a little pointy but it also smooths out the tip of the nail which does the same thing absorb the shock if you were to hit the nail I recommend oval nails if you have a longer nail bed it doesn't look good if your nail is really short let's try the squared with the round edges first you clip the nail if it needs to be clipped and then you take a nail file and you file across safety tip if you're at a salon you want to know that you're the first person that use the nail file it should be wrapped there pennies if not look around the sides and make sure that it hasn't been used if not you can request it to shape it	val_2	1738
v_JE50XTpCN78	Then, the woman polish the fingernail of the index of a person using a nail file	94.18	144.56	219.03	13.0	it hasn't been used if not you can request it to shape it square you always go straight across to give it that squared shape now this is an emery board file straight across and then you'll take your fingers and try of course if you're at home squeeze the finger skin on the side and always go in one direction when you're doing the corners this way you don't create hang nails if you're doing the squared with rounded edges you classify as I said flat across here and then put your nail Fahmy about a 45 degree angle and file across this way what it does is it just smooths out the corner of the nail so that it doesn't snag and it just gives it a nice rounded side but a nice flat look straight across to create this oval look you definitely cut the nail on a stronger angle about 45	val_2	1739
v_JE50XTpCN78	After, the woman cuts the sides of the nails	145.66	159.89	219.03	13.0	create this oval look you definitely cut the nail on a stronger angle about 45 degrees and you're going to cut it as if you're making a V on the nail and if so if you're at home you're going to cut this way and then this way this time	val_2	1740
v_JE50XTpCN78	After, the woman gives form to the nails with the nail file	160.99	216.84	219.03	13.0	this way and then this way this time you're going to file on a deeper angle because you want to create that oval look it's almost like you're filing your nail into a V and once you get that point as you can see the nail is starting to form a point and always follow the same direction squeeze the finger on the side always downward to avoid the hangnail you see that there's a diamond shape or V at the free edge now so to round that off and just smooth it out take the nail file and go straight across and tilt it up just a little bit to round it off I also recommend sometimes if you're going to do this type of filing use a glass nail file it really smooths out the free edge and avoids the hangnail you'll see a big difference	val_2	1741

v_tyjUDi3uLd0	And then comes on and talks about some key points to remember when doing a flooring project	4.72	74.31	235.92000000000002	13.0	oh boy check this out hi I'm Tim Carter from master builder comm thanks for joining me today I'm in this room that we're remodeling and we have to extend a tile floor into this area that's not finished check that out the reason that happened is just about 10 days ago right where I'm standing there used to be a wall that went all the way to the ceiling we took it down so that the two rooms will now become one the challenge is this check this out if you go ahead and start to lay the tile go in this direction behind me and you think that you'll be able to line it up with your eye making sure that the lines are perfect it's not going to happen you'll make a mistake every time you actually need to create a line on this concrete slab that you will actually lay the tile to so that you know that those rows are straight and here's one way that I've done in the past works pretty well you can use just a regular chalk line this one happens to have no chalk on it yet if you're going to use one that's already got shock make sure you pull the chalk line out and snap it a couple times to get as much chalk off as possible but check this out come here	val_2	1922
v_tyjUDi3uLd0	He then proceeded to show a method of balancing tiles on my floor with a string	74.31	202.89	235.92000000000002	13.0	times to get as much chalk off as possible but check this out come here all you have to do is open up the chalk line and you you hook the chalk line right to the underside of the time you can see right here I took the end of the chalk line hooked it to the underside of this tile pull the string tight and then what I do and I look real closely here I'd go ahead right here and I get this string lined up right with that edge of the tile that's exactly what I want to see right there so I know it's right then I take the chalk line and I come back down here and what I can do first of all is do this as I can actually use the line the string line and I can see by just hovering it over the edge of this time that these tiles are perfectly in line that's exactly what we want to see so now what we all do is I can make a line right here right underneath the string line on the concrete slab so we know where that point is we come back here and then I line up the string looking right down the string put my eye right over it and you can see that I can swing the string left and right until it's right at the edge of the tile which it is right there you can see it right over the edge of the tile I put the string down here make a mark and if you take a heavy object like a full paint can I can sit it on the string so now the string won't move and I can go ahead and make marks right underneath the string in a couple of places and then if you want you can take a straight edge like a four foot level connect those lines you've got your straight line to start laying your tile I'm Tim Carter for ask the Builder com	val_2	1923

v_UkA6pgt29VI	We see several people engaged in water sports	36.64	139.46	236.38	4.0	because you shouldn't be heading out into the surf zone without them the first thing to mention is how important it is that you be aware of your surroundings as a rule when you're learning to surf or if you're unsure of your ability to control your gear in the surf zone do not surf where there are other surfers swimmers or even waiters it's simply too dangerous for both you and those around you whether you're recovering from a fall or just piling out you have three real options for getting through the surf one option is to lie down on your board and paddle out with your paddle on the deck in front of you this can work in smaller waves but big waves will knock you over and wash you back in the best way to deal with big waves from the lying down position is to get off your board push down on the tail and push the board over the foam as you dive under the foam while holding your paddle the second option is to paddle out in a kneeling position and ride over the whitewater by leaning back and taking a hard stroke as you hit the phone once again this technique will work in smaller waves but it won't be very effective when waves get over around three feet the third and best option for getting out through the surf is to actually stand up and paddle but you need to learn how to punch over the whitewater first when standing and paddling out through the surf you'll want to assume a hybrid stance with your front foot pointed forwards and your back foot more sideways you'll also want to have your feet slightly staggered one towards the nose and one slightly towards the tail you'll also want to be standing a little further back on your board to make it easier to get the nose on top of the Whitewater when you're punching over the top of waves now what you'll want to do is take a few solid but smooth strokes	val_2	2393
v_UkA6pgt29VI	A man talks about his brand and their support of those sports	146.56	236.38	236.38	4.0	some forward momentum towards the incoming wave having forward momentum is extremely important because without it you're much less stable as the foam approaches you're going to want to keep your center of gravity low by bending your knees just as the foam is approaching the nose of your board you're going to plant a solid stroke and you're also going to want to put pressure on your back foot don't lean back but put pressure in your back foot keeping your center of gravity over your board you're going to take that stroke and the pressure on the back foot is going to lift the nose over the phone you might find it helpful to move your back foot further back as you do this if all goes as planned your board will skip up on to and over the foam pile the key to making this work is keeping your knees bent and your center of gravity over your board you're going to also maintain an active paddle that mean you're going to have that paddle blade in the water or you're going to have it on the surface of water acting as a brace if you get knocked off balance you may have to drop to one knee but you'll need to get up as quickly as possible and get ready for the next wave if you're interested in learning more about BIC stand-up paddleboards or if you're looking for advice on how to choose the right board for you check us out at Vic su P calm visit BIC su p comm and check out the full range of stand-up paddleboards paddles and accessories	val_2	2394

Louis area once you get used to it it's really nice here's how a hookah pipe works tobacco is placed at the top of the pipe once lit smoke flows through a water filter at the bottom it's kind of like licorice but does that mean it's healthier than smoking a cigarette the big myth is that it's not as harmful as cigarette smoking dr dayton dimelo says the water filter in a hookah pipe doesn't prevent hookah smokers from inhaling nicotine less than five percent of nicotine is actually filtered out by water so you end up getting as much of a cigarette again if not more it's something that doesn't surprise Wallace I think there's some people have the misimpression that it is healthier but that's an illusion really because it just feels cooler because it's going through water but he says he'll continue to smoke hookah at least for a while it's probably just a phase I'm going through now the other thing to remember is that people generally smoke hookah for a lot longer than people smoke a cigarette all new at ten i'll tell you how that factors into how much nicotine they inhaled reporting live in st.

v_iosb2TdQ7yY	He is discussing the tree in the yard	45.04	81.99	230.97	9.0	out here so just have a look at this world quite a storm we went to upwards of 130 five kilometer an hour winds knocked the power out so we're going on two days now with no power got a generator running in the background hence the noise has to keep the refrigerator going so that my steaks and chicken breasts and all that don't go go bad	val_2	2969
v_iosb2TdQ7yY	He uses an ax to chop the branches from the fallen tree	115.48	230.97	230.97	9.0	so after several hours of work we've got the trees cut trimmed and limbed and you can see the big pile of tree branches there it was actually a lot of work these trees the way they had blown doubt and stacked on top of each other and pushed up against the garage it made it really awkward to get in there and to cut them but luckily there was no damage done I mean the grad was really strong and was able to withstand those six trees blowing down against it we got ourselves a lot of firewood as you can see right there but overall I was very lucky that we had no damage and that's no no problems at all actually other than domestically not so thankful for that and got some fresh air and a bit of exercise to boot so it wasn't too bad after all you	val_2	2970
v_i0Z8I2WCLNk	A man comes onto the screen and explain some key concepts to know about pruning grape vines for the winter	0.0	85.94	190.99	13.0	hi everyone Felix eagerness today we're talking about grip care in the late winter season some pruning and also a little bit about how to train these plants this is a four year old grapevine here we've trained the primary shoot nicely so you're planting would be here you have that cane we coming up and it would break a chute and you want to train that nice and straight like we have here and for a single curtain system like we've trained this guy which is really a nice training system for mass productions really to good productivity basically we took one suit taking one direction here for this two primary shoots to make our single person that are on this top wire so there's old Irvine who has a lot of last season's growth on it which of the shoots here that are about pencil bag a little thicker and on these shoots of some buds you can see here they haven't broken yet but you can see them you look closely here but that's right there is a but that's going to break and there will be a flower shoot off of that that's where a cluster will form is on that new shoot coming after so for pruning you look along this curtain here we have a number of those that have come out last season and really we only want two or three shoots to break off of this last season's growth so the pruning approach here is to take these match 2-1 - we have another but on the other side I'm	val_2	2971
v_i0Z8I2WCLNk	When he is done with his explanation he proceeded to prune back several of the vines in a strategic manner	85.94	165.2	190.99	13.0	here is to take these match 2-1 - we have another but on the other side I'm just going to leave two there so we're going to trim this back see a nice vibrant green tissue there and we have a couple of plugs and so we want to do that all along this curtain here is to take these stains from last season back to the few buds - that is a goal here and these long growing buds the shooting is going low and underneath it's going to be under the canopy the whole time so that's not doing us any good and here we have a couple of others a little tie back and on the backside can you two do that Jenna's growing underneath see what we've done here on this hole Brian shears part of the curtain we've taken the shirts back - it's weird vibes and we'll show later in another video how the shoots will	val_2	2972
v_i0Z8I2WCLNk	When he finishes up with the pruning he explains some additional concepts that should be known	165.2	190.99	190.99	13.0	- it's weird vibes and we'll show later in another video how the shoots will initiate from there and then you'll be able to see how flower bud develops off of those and we'll cover that so you're not identifying your flower buds and where your clusters will be and then in another video we'll talk a little bit about fruit thinning then in your cluster so you get math massive berries and just balanced crop load on this vine and those will be some nice points to look for on some later videos thanks for joining us	val_2	2973

v_m_gr7WdjJmc	He demonstrates how to slide down the ramp on a pair of skis	30.8	144.68	186.69	4.0	help you get the most out of a dry state the great thing about dry search is they're inexpensive they're very accessible but more importantly they provide a consistent surface to trainers now if you're coming to scale on a dry site for the first time you've already skied on snow there are two principles that can really help you get the most out of this right the first one is to keep your feet underneath your body don't be too edgy in your performance to start with a good way to practice this is to start off in a snow plow until you can feel yourself balancing against your outside skin from there you're easily progressing two parallel turns the second thing that can really help on a dry site is to make sure you're balanced over the center of the foot a good way of checking this is to do some straight running right at the bottom of the hill and do a few small jumps or hops on the way down if the whole ski is coming off the ground we know that your Center you can then progress and put this into a parallel turns to ensure that when you're going gets tough you're still balanced	val_2	3098
v_m_gr7WdjJmc	He shows the turns and postures required for skiing	144.68	186.69	186.69	4.0	you're still balanced the most important thing to remember with a dry slate is that because your movements need to be more refined it's an incredibly good way of training before you go snow you can get it right on here you'll be king of the hill	val_2	3099

v_ph7d2H77tks	He takes a wrench and adjusts the seat	21.58	62.16	172.66	13.0	seat adjusts up and down and it adjusts off-kilter forward and back so what you can do is you grab a 14 millimeter wrench either be a ratchet or standard box wrench and you loosen these bolts up under here you want to be careful you have a bolt on this side and a bolt on this side you really want to try to adjust them evenly once you get it loose enough you'll be able to click the seat back and forth some people prefer it a little bit up some people a little bit down I'm usually pretty much even right in the middle so I'm going to go ahead and tap that up now what you want to do for comfort you should want to be pretty fully extended on what's called down metal the down pedal is the furthest point down that the pedal can go so when	val_2	3105
v_ph7d2H77tks	He mounts the bicycle to test the seat position	63.02	101.01	172.66	13.0	metal the down pedal is the furthest point down that the pedal can go so when I'm sitting on this guy I want to be almost fully extended just have a little bit of a bend in my line this for me is a little bit too cramped so I'm going to raise the seat up a little bit I'm going to do that by using a five millimeter allen key now there's just one point in the seat post here you loosen up I'm going to raise it up out just under an inch kick back on yeah that's right I wanna be tippy-toe here almost fully extended here and I have both feet off I'm pretty tippy toes but I can almost lean to the side and so now let's come over the	val_2	3106
v_ph7d2H77tks	He readjusts the handlebar position	101.87	172.66	172.66	13.0	tippy toes but I can almost lean to the side and so now let's come over the handlebars here we have the stem and the handlebars the stem is where all your adjustment points your first adjustment point is where the step actually goes into the frame of the bicycle you loosen that up with a six millimeter allen key here that guy loosens up and then you really have about three inches of play there's some lines on the stem to indicate where you should be go past I usually put it about a half-inch below those lines it's where it's comfortable for me it may be comfortable a little bit different from depending on your height I'm about five seven then you have the angle of the handlebars loosen up here and just really whatever way you like whatever way you feel most comfortable handling handling the bike I usually get these guys up right about like that where my handles be right like this in front of you before I feel I have the best control when I'm right and again it's going to be different for different people so now this bike 26 inch rubber bands ready to ride I hope that helps you guys and of course if you need anything just give us a call	val_2	3107

v_nrvB8pcrY7o	He is shown stripping and cleaning a water ski	35.08	121.03	175.4	4.0	your skins the hairs will kind of curl up and bite into the snow even more good for grip not that good for Glide keep it low um experiment with the different types of waxes you're using just kind of see what works best with you these are skins before being waxed the pelts not super smooth hairs are sort of fuzzy not that buffed out so once your rigs all lined up in the vise just start rub a good dose of wax on there you don't want to get too gloppy but you know you can go over it once and then hit some spots that didn't didn't get it too hard obviously you don't want it get it goood up too much I was about the max you really want to look like more you put on there you're more you have to heat up the iron and get it all hot and danger burning your skin so don't go too heavy once you got it all waxed up bust out the iron get it all going and it's nice just do nice even pass tip-to-tail obviously want to go back and forth but you can kind of feel melt and see it melting into the skin it's it's kind of a cool deal to watch for the hairs get all in alignment it's a little bit harder to get the edges for some reasons so usually I go back down and focus on the edges a little bit more I try to get them nice and melted in there and you can kind of see sections where this the wax hasn't really melted so you'll kind of live and learn with this this part this is my backcountry rig so I'm gonna go over and give her another dose	val_2	3118
v_nrvB8pcrY7o	He shows the fabric up close as he talks about how to do it	136.82	175.4	175.4	4.0	maybe she's saving for race day really wet conditions can't really see it helping out and colder temps but I've experimenting with some colder temperature waxes ironing them in but you know it's just get sketchy with the iron burning your basis so you know yellow or pink something like that as you can see here this is after waxing all the pelt was really lined up it's it's really uniform nice and flat give it a really good glide resistance the glopping up i've also experimented with brushing them with a wire brush and that seems to really help maybe in between ironing so anyway happy skiing thanks a lot lift ski	val_2	3119

v_Opqg11Nkb7c	the man then gathers sticks from the forest	41.47	116.7	192.89	13.0	all of your materials ready to go will make the biggest difference in a successful fire and could be the difference between life and death in an emergency situation in this demonstration Steve is going to use a lighter a 9-volt battery was steel wool and magnesium fire starter with a knife to use as the spark element to light the fire next you will need fuel or the spark to ignite it is very important that you start your fire with small dry fibers called tinder some examples of tinder are dry grass from the environment which can be made into a small bundle to place your spark lint from your clothes dryer and toilet paper is a great option since it's usually always on hand to use a lighter to start a fire simply place your tinder in the firing with your kindling which is small dry sticks or wood shavings in this example Steve is using shredded up toilet paper and some dryer lint as tinder once the tinder is lit gently blow on it to increase the intensity of the flame to assist in getting the kindling to catch fire to use steel wool and a 9-volt battery take your tinder in this case a bundle of dry grass and place a thin layer of steel wool over it then touch the steel wool with both	val_2	3130
v_Opqg11Nkb7c	with the sticks the man begins to make a fire	111.88	192.89	192.89	13.0	and a 9-volt battery take your tinder in this case a bundle of dry grass and place a thin layer of steel wool over it then touch the steel wool with both terminals of your battery this will create several sparks blow gently on the tinder and once it has ignited into a flame place your kindling on top continue to blow gently to help with catching your small sticks on the third and most difficult of these examples is the magnesium fire starter you must have really fine tinder and lots of practice to pull this off start off by scraping a pile of magnesium shavings into your tinder then strike the pile using your knife and fire starter as with the other examples once your tinder is lit place your kindling on top and blow gently to get the fire started once your fire is going on its own you can gradually add bigger and bigger pieces of wood or fuel to your fire make sure not to add too much too fast or your fire will be smothered and go out now you're ready to go for more camping and hiking tips visit Teton sports comm and click on the adventure hub tab Teton sports do it right you	val_2	3131

v_U6-j4rUn3dk	She is talking while holding a plant in front of her	21.98	79.46	169.07	13.0	one to start with it's the most forgiving if you can't kill it without trying really hard to kill it but what you want to do is when you go to choose a plant it's important that you start with the right shape now what I like to do is find something that has a lot of fullness I can go in later and I can turn away any of these little branches I want if you want to make say a lollipop and you want the just a solid stem then you want to start early by cutting all those lower branches leaving this globe and then as it gets taller you just keep trimming away below if you want to have a globe on the ground a little gumdrop we call it then you want to do the opposite you want to keep cutting from the top and what's going to happen if you do that is it's going to keep the bottom full of foliage so you have to decide first what is my shape what am I going to do on the other hand if you want one of those triple ball-type you'll slowly train the first one and	val_2	3353
v_U6-j4rUn3dk	she then shows how to transfer the plant to the soil	94.68	169.07	169.07	13.0	of nice foliage the nice thing about box is that as you cut it it just gets denser and denser if you get something with large leaves when you go to trim it they're going to be chopped off and they don't look good so those are better for SPLA or if you want to do like the umbrella pines where you leave the needles alone and you just cut down on the branches that's fine too but if you want to do something like this use box or something similar with the tiny type dense leaf structure and all you really have to do this one of course is a little rounded I've already trimmed it a little before what you do is every time you see something like this you trim it just keep it trimmed and do it and don't wait till it's way out of shape and then cut it back because then you will have bare areas you want to keep it cut as often as possible use a nice pair of kitchen or garden shears like this and I just trim it I use these throughout my herb garden so that in the winter when all the herbs die back I have some greenery so I want to keep mine round and low to the ground but as you can see you have a choice decide what you're going to do and the main thing is pick the right plant and do it diligently and it's very simple and you'll have a topiary	val_2	3354

v_Sd08rsPTroE	A man is seen speaking to the camera and holding up various tools	0.0	51.52	234.2	2.0	in today's tutorial we're going to talk a little bit about how to play double kicker the right way there's a common misconception in the drumming world that to play drums successfully you need to use your feet and your legs and this is just not true all you need are your hands and your mind and your soul to play successfully so first thing you've got to do is reprogram your thinking about drumming you do not need to use your legs or your feet it's just an old wives tale it's basically a pointless so we just need to get rid of a few unnecessary drum parts and then we'll be able to play many people spend hundreds of dollars on double kickers which	val_2	3946
v_Sd08rsPTroE	He is then seen sitting behind a drum set points to drums and begins playing	55.04	161.6	234.2	2.0	require knowledge and skill and talent and things like that you do not need some contraption like that that is hindering your personal and intellectual growth I'm going to show you the correct way to play the double kicker and you can do it today for free and pretty much be in the best band ever by this weekend so let's take a look and I'll show you the secret so the first thing you'll need to do is get rid of your unnecessary drum elements most people think you need all those drums in the standard drum kit you don't they're basically useless so just get rid of them all leave your kick drum and just set it up like this get rid of the kick pedal get rid of the pedal get rid of all the other drums all you need is your kick you need your snare and you need two cymbals you got to crash a ride here I left the hi-hat up just for show 30% of all Americans believe that if you know how to use a hi-hat you're more intelligent than others so I'm not going to use it but I just left it up here to look good so once you've altered your set you're ready to go the basic philosophy here is that instead of using your legs and your feet to do kick or pedal all you need is your hands and you'll just reproduce the sound by hitting with your sticks it's very easy and in fact this is the way most professional drummers do it so here's a little sample real easy this is how some people like when like first learning how to use drums but we're going to add some hardcore to it so so	val_2	3947
v_Sd08rsPTroE	He pauses to speak to the camera as well as play more	145.2	218.97	234.2	2.0	learning how to use drums but we're going to add some hardcore to it so so those are the basics you'll need to practice for about four or five minutes before you master this skill but once you do I believe you will be more hardcore than most drummers and you will be the envy of all your friends so those are the basics get to work we'll just leave you with a little more demonstrations of the amazing power of the right way to play the double kicker	val_2	3948

v_Vl4gId1_zxo	He then walks out onto a field with young children and giving them a kite	59.21	130.72	223.45	11.0	to lose and they store these little stuff sacks so it's easy to store toss them into a beach bag or in the back of the minivan that you can get a kite like this on Amazon and usually at a good independent toy store at about the same twenty dollar price point you can pick up one of these stunt kites it's also made of durable nylon and it's got two handles that allows you to maneuver it now these are exciting particularly to older boys but you definitely lose some of the Zen factor now if you really want to be a kite cake you can go for one of these large floormat air forms it's the same design except much bigger this one's about thirty square feet the problem is these are more for the adults and for the kids they really pull if you've got a breeze that's more stout than say ten miles per hour it's gonna carry away your little kid like Curious George with his balloons once my daughter even lost control of a little airfoil like this one she came to the door absolutely undone tears flowing down her face she was handing the kite over to her friend when they let go and it flew away but right behind her Kati and she looked up and she said it's still flying we go outside and sure enough there it is 500 feet up in the sky a tiny little scrap of rainbow and I know that this day is about to be saved	val_2	4209
v_Vl4gId1_zxo	He holds up a kite and bag while speaking to the camera while more clips are shown of him and his children flying kites	124.01	214.51	223.45	11.0	still flying we go outside and sure enough there it is 500 feet up in the sky a tiny little scrap of rainbow and I know that this day is about to be saved by super dad all they have to do is find a bright blue ring like this one wedged in a tree somewhere on the afternoon of the third day while I'm at work the wind dies down and I convinced myself that it will now be easy to find the kite in the canopy of trees in our neighborhood but after two more hours of neck craning I realize that what I'm now looking for is a metaphor what is this kite trying to teach me about my desire to be a super dad about the limitation of will when applied to a problem I'm eating dinner with a family under a funk of defeat when someone's at the door again is Katie because she says it's in our tree and as I'm clamoring on to my neighbor's roof I realize that I've slipped a bond and I need to consciously remember not to risk my life with the help of Katie's dad hauling down a limb and the use of a tree trimmer and finally able to reel in the kite I feel like a quarterback in the middle of a ticker-tape parade winning Super Bowl Sunday so what's the takeaway here flying a kite with your kids can be a simple pleasure or a complex metaphor or both maybe if you want to be a super dad your cape	val_2	4210

v_RgMAHuMVRcU	They keep trimming the trees as they go	181.35	222.52	222.52	14.0	stays on the cuts it can also lead to rot here you can see how the theory of pruning is put into practice pruning is a very effective way to enhance the quality of your foods at the same time you can reduce the cost of production so if you aim to produce high-quality mangoes at an affordable price you should consistently prune your trees good luck with your own pruning hopefully you will soon have beautiful and productive mango trees	val_2	4256

v_WxlJBRUU1A0	She is showing how to knit an item	39.63	149.47	226.47	13.0	cable needle which has a point on both ends which is very important if you notice here I have got four knit stitches that are the next ones on my left needle I'm going to use the cable needle to actually manipulate these stitches so that it changes the order they present themselves in so the first cable I'm going to show you is a cable fall back I'm going to take two of the stitches onto the cable needles hold them at the back of the work so that's away from you I'm going to knit the next two stitches from the left needle and now I'm going to knit the two from the cable needle it's really just as simple as that and now you notice that I've actually crossed those stitches I'm gonna show you again so that I know my hands work a little fast my hands are very used to doing this so here again for net stitches I slide the first two onto the cable needle hold them at the back of the work and now knit the two from the left needle and now knit the two from the cable needle that's a cable 4 back the total number of stitches involved is four that's not the number that you put onto the cable needle it's a 50-50 split I'm now going to show you what happens when you hold the cable needle to the front so this would be a cable 4 front same number of stitches but this time when we slide the stitches onto the cable needle I'm going to hold them at the front of the work so that's towards you go ahead and knit the two next two from the left hand needle and then the two from the cable needle so you can see it's the same as a cable 4 back it's the only change is that position that you hold the cable needle in while you're actually transferring the stitches from the left needle and I'm going to show you one more time slide the two onto the cable needle hold at the front of the work net the two from the left needle and then knit the two from the cable needle	val_2	5106
v_WxlJBRUU1A0	She is using a needle and yarn to knit	163.05	226.47	226.47	13.0	are set on this ground of reverse stockinette so we have the purl bumpy side of the the reverse stockinette showing first and then we have the smooth part where the cables are taking place the difference between these two textures is what enables the eye to see the pattern the cable fallbacks when they're stacked vertically on top of each other appear to be spinning in a counterclockwise direction creating this classic wrote the cable forefront stacked vertically on top of each other spin in the opposite direction so in a clockwise motion but they look very similar these are just the very basic building blocks that we use for cable knitting and you can see this is what we traditionally think of as a an errand sweater with these traditional cable ropes I hope that you'll go ahead and try this and and hope that you'll love the technique as much as I do there's these are the both basic building blocks and when you actually get into doing more elaborate stitches you're still using the very similar techniques thank you for watching	val_2	5107

v_rxfkWIGZtlQ	Then, the woman takes off the adapter of the hair dryer and continues explaining	48.09	102.26	121.74	13.0	to help moisturize the hair during the blow drying process other blow dryers have nozzles and such some of them have comb extenders so when you're choosing a blow dryer you want to make sure that it's a lightweight make sure that it's not too heavy make sure that you have a long enough cord that doesn't tangle up very easily you also want to make sure that it has a low EMF now EMF doesn't mean a lot to some of you but it needs a lot to me as a hair stylist because this is what I use everyday EMF is the electronic magnetic field and what it does is it helps to create ions for the hair which keeps the hair healthy and it keeps me healthy the last electronic magnetic in the air in the atmosphere the better my health so remember when you choose a blow dryer	val_2	5374
v_rxfkWIGZtlQ	Te woman continues talking holding on her right hand the hair dryer, and showing the hair of the female with the left hand	102.87	121.13	121.74	13.0	in the atmosphere the better my health so remember when you choose a blow dryer make sure that it's lightweight make sure that it has a ceramic inside the blow dryer make sure it infuses moisture into the hair when you do these things you will have great healthy hair my name is Sylvia and this is how you choose a bow driver	val_2	5375

v_stVRtmxHVaE	He continues removing them so they can be replaced	148.77	234.29	234.29	9.0	on this roof is really in bad shape at the moment so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a long shim stick here if it doesn't snap on me now I've already been working on the other side so I know that I I've been able to work this so far and with some roof cement I'm gonna lift that area up and I'm gonna I'm gonna take a lot of this stuff and I'm gonna put it as far back as I can under the shingles perhaps from here's the edge as far back is here so that you get some clean area to help this stuff cement down again I think it's important because sooner or later the winds gonna work its way under this thing and lift it up as a blanket and you don't want that to happen I already found one roofing nail on the other side that apparently came from this valley so that's an indication that it's getting weak so this will help give it some strength in its remaining years so that's what I wanted you folks to know that if you go up on a roof and you have a valley where the shingles are tucked like this you might want to check that if it's an older roof an older roof is anything over ten years because you could be in for a surprise in a bad storm	val_2	6111

v_8nQGd6hiduA	This leads into him demonstrating how to properly hit the ball while speaking to the camera	42.78	111.56	167.77	13.0	do is toss the ball a little further or one degree more out in front so if you're hitting your serve five feet long it's five feet beyond that service line all you have to do is toss the ball just a little bit more in front or one degree more in front to get the racket vertical when you hit now the ball is going to land six feet shorter or if your one foot beyond the service line now it'll be five feet inside this service line so remember those two points lean and toss out in front and also think about keeping the head and chest up because you don't want to hit down okay this next drill lean and toss towards the net is going to prevent you from hitting the ball long remember by tossing it further out in front it gives you a racket a chance to get vertical remember you want it straight up and down vertical you don't want to think down so we're also going to think head and chest up again because many players when they lean in tend to hit down you want to lean in but you also want to keep the racket up and out you don't want to think down so remember our two key points lean and toss in towards the net and keep your	val_2	6312

v_I9NukwdINyY	A woman is seen standing inside a room	0.0	31.46	202.99	11.0	hi I'm melody on behalf of expert village I'm going to show you how to use more of the tools that go along with making yourself an acrylic painting and we've got a lot of tools to go over here so I'll try and make it as clear as possible all right basically if you're just starting out you don't want to spend too much money so I would just say go down to your craft store or a store that has painting items and I would get a kit a set of very simple brushes just	val_2	7241
v_I9NukwdINyY	She shows off several brushes and a canvas	47.7	133.97	202.99	11.0	different brushes for different purposes if you have in mind to paint something extremely large for your first painting then you can also just go down same-store or even your your local paint store and pick up some brushes like these they're very inexpensive compared to the real art brushes but if you buy the more expensive of the choices in your hardware stores you'll be okay and you can probably get two paintings out of this before the hairs will be falling out and you'll have to throw it away or use it for something else so there's that idea now depending on what you're painting again I prefer to use the slanted brushes that are at an edge they're not straight they're actually curved and that way if I'm at an easel and I'm at a slant to the easel or I'm trying to make a specific design it moves freely and there's no clumping whereas if you had a flat brush I'll use this big one to demonstrate you've got a straight motion which is a a blob which you may use in some paintings but you'd like to have something that will give you some extra control to so if you put the blob on and you pull it it gets fatter if you use one of these you can control it to the point of making it actually thinner line and you can twist it then	val_2	7242
v_I9NukwdINyY	She demonstrates how to make a painting	147.17	202.99	202.99	11.0	use of the slanted versus the straight and it all depends on what you're painting again if you're doing a lot of greenery foliage branches of trees one of these brushes a fan brush is a very good idea and these also come in many sizes and thicknesses and this is all I have today to show you but they go in an array of sizes all the way to huge and and larger than this even so again it depends on what you're painting but if you're doing a lot of trees we'll show you this later in another segment but this is a great one for grasses and for tree limbs and for bushes and for highlights so in our next segment we'll continue showing you how to use some of the tools to create an acrylic painting	val_2	7243

v_SLdf2ZUdgEQ	He holds up a string and discusses how to use it	24.05	116.11	165.87	14.0	better timing what I'm going to do is give you a prop to show you exactly what we're talking about this tip uses a simple product and what you see here is I've got a road and I've tied two loops on each end the length of the rope is the distance from your foot to your arm which is about waist-high so what we're going to do is demonstrate this drill for you okay so as you can see I've got my rope bottom of the foot to about waist level the lower loop is hooked around my foot more so I'm right-handed so it's going to be on my right foot the top loop we're going to pull across to the center of the elbow now the purpose of this drill obviously is to give you good timing two types of timing or what we see in bowling you're out there early or you're out there laying so I want to demonstrate for you so get in your stance position right foot slightly back you get your hands in the ball holding position okay so what we're going to do is you're going to demonstrate wrong timing to begin with a lot of bowlers are a lot of times late just want to demonstrate what late timing is the right foot is going to start well before the right elbow here we go right foot moves as you can see the right elbow didn't move now the other problem we see with bowlers is what we call early timing let me demonstrate that all it is is when you have your ball placed into the swing too quick here we go then we step and that gives us a problem with timing all the time now here's what we want for really really good timing this is the relationship right elbow right foot is going to start together	val_2	7276
v_SLdf2ZUdgEQ	He then demonstrates the positions and techniques of bowling	120.26	165.87	165.87	14.0	time and as you can see the room is right over my kneecap up to the elbow that's going to initiate a very good start to give you what we want good timing so one more time let me demonstrate good timing remember what we want is the right foot right elbow exactly at the same time here we go so this tip is really good for beginners and intermediates what that's going to do is get you to the foul line and better timing to help get you a better release okay so I hope you've enjoyed this week's tip for a personalized lesson you can send your videos to me at Richard Shockley's virtual bowling academy.com to help you take your game to another level	val_2	7277

v_B-6kP8M_GmM	The men continue hitting one another and the host speaks to the camera	139.96	180.08	186.61	4.0	actually increases love stability in win shoulder meet stomach deprivation generates nearly twenty six hundred pounds of force it's liver bite in terms of not a force that you experienced during a game how accurate said I was pretty yet good obviously the weight is distributed a little bit different but it was definitely tough to put the battle under the board's in perspective if Kevin Love experienced only a third of that twenty six hundred pound collision in each of his rebounds last season he still would have experienced a cumulative total of nearly 1 million pounds of force for ESPN sports science I'm John Brenkus	val_2	7376

Diana Ostroff is not the only one concern that you're breathing in questionable chemicals when you lather up with spray-on sunscreen the FDA has been investigating spray sunscreen since 2011 but is yet to reach a verdict recently consumer reports issued a warning against the sprays advising parents to stay away from using them on their children people that have sensitivities toward inhalants asthma allergies sinus problems are going to have an increased concern I think I might use a rub on if it's questionable right now but even if you make the switch you may not be home free experts are concerned not only	val_2	7822

v_nXNczyQpljQ	He adjusts the reed in the mouthpiece	31.67	132.82	204.34	13.0	continued where you're actually stopping the reed with your tongue about here without stopping the airflow so you can hear the air continue but the note is starting and stopping because I'm controlling the reed not the air so when we apply this two scales here is a D major scale on the alto saxophone not articulated another word for that is slurred and then here it is the same thing again all articulated the airflow continued which tell you one place Gail's staccato is a different thing is where you stop the year the D major scale staccato would be like this we can continue this exercise with major scales by tonguing every second note so which is also referred to as back tonguing and that sounds like this that's really helpful when playing fast as opposed to slurred another tonguing technique is commonly used in and and I have a lot of students ask me about slap tonguing which is hard to explain but a lot much like riding a	val_2	7888

v_xqzsv8VpaNM	the man then returns to talk to the camera	122.07	163.85	163.85	13.0	the last point of sail is a downwind run this is when you're heading towards 6 o'clock and the wind is coming straight across your Stern for this point of sail you want to have your cell all the way out like a big parachute to catch all the wind an easy way to figure out where your cell should be as long as you're not in irons and the sails flopping over your head is to let the sail out until it starts flapping a little bit next you pull it in just enough so it's full of air again that was wind direction points of sail and sail trim next is tacking and driving to watch the other segments in this video series or for how-to videos on almost any other topic visit monkey sea calm	val_2	7973

v_5_M10vevgJg	A man is waxing the bottom of a ski	64.14	194.48	206.89	4.0	on the tail and the tip of the ski and the skate ski is done the whole way the method and the wax is exactly the same for both than that we won't do the middle on a classic ski Alan suggests waxing your skis in November before you start and then again in january or februari all you need is an old iron a block of wax and we're going to drip this down the ski this is a skate ski that we're doing now so it's going to be the full length of the ski and then moving the iron along fairly quickly so as we're not staying in one spot too long way we're going to burn the base you don't want your iron to smoke you want it to be able hot enough to melt the wax and smooth it out on the ski but not enough to smoke the wax which essentially is putting too much heat into the base of your ski and then you risk damaging your ski once you finish waxing will take and scrape the groove of the ski and then with a plastic scraper we're going to then turn around and scrape the ski always keep the skeet the scraper on the base and I'm scraping off on the push and then just pulling the scraper back now the heat drives the wax into the base and that's what you want and we wanted to take the excess off next you need to take a brush and if you want to make it a little faster yet will take a few passes with no pressure with a wire brush of some sort and then polish it up either with a your nylon brush again or this one is a little bit finer softer brush fill the polishing brush and that's all there is to waxing your classic or skate skis for glide so	val_2	7981

v_baSx0q9LKg0	when ready the cake is in a tray and the woma put chocolate syrup on the cake and freeze	94.49	205.51	236.22	13.0	come out really adorable and they're super light and airy too and then here is our chocolate bar cake out of the oven before you take it out of the pan run a knife around the edge of the cake to release the sides and also let it cool completely then just flip this out into a serving plate or cooling rack and very gently start to release the cake from the mold and you can see you'll have this really cute sponge cake now I'm just going to trim off the edges this is going to help the cake sit in the mold better and feel free to eat any of the extra scraps make sure you trim all four sides of the cake if you want to be really picky about it you can also trim in between the chocolate bars and this will again help it's it better in the mold now I'm going to melt a 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips and I'm melting this over a double boiler now I'm just going to start pouring the chocolate into our cleaned pan at first I used a spoon to do this but then I realized that a brush would be much easier so go ahead and just light on a thick coat of chocolate around all the edges and then once you've finished that gently place your cake into the pan and press it down just a little bit then once you've done that you want to cover the entire thing with more chocolate as you can see this recipe uses a lot of chocolate but that's fine by me this can get a little bit messy but just your best then tap it a few times on your counter and this will really help set the chocolate and give you a nice smooth finish then once you've done this pop it in the fridge for about 20 minutes to set and then once it's completely set gently start removing the cake from the sides of the pan and now you can pop it out onto your plate so	val_2	8296

v_1ioKX0iuico	Another person is swimming in the water, waiting for a water board	22.15	110.74	177.18	15.0	wakeboard or not um you have to put it on right away so just open that up slip your foot into it you can kind of hold the board with your other foot until you get that one nice and tight remember to put it if it's your first time as tight as possible don't worry about anything um usually they advise you not to put it too tight since it can be dangerous however if it's your first time it's better just to put a really tight because you might not get up the first time usually you won't so you need somebody to pass you the rope for sure you need somebody driving the boat it's in a spotter so the spotters going to tell the person driving the boat if you fail or not um so it's really important to go with two other people also the other person the spotter can see if the rope gets tangled or not you always do want to put the rope over the board so it doesn't tangle anywhere so remember to put that just over the board just like that and just be careful not to get tangled and you want to hold on right away with two hands and as you're getting up I just remembered your feet and your hands and your um your arms have to be bent the whole time and don't worry about getting up too fast as you can see here I gradually got up I'm going to show you a next clip where I can show you that you don't really need to stand up you can just stay kind of sitting down while it's pulling you up so you just want to keep	val_2	8314

v_6fuOwhx91zM	He is holding a skateboard as he talks	16.22	55.6	92.67	4.0	how to skate the easiest way to stop on a skateboard or to slow your speed is to lightly depress the tail until it comes in contact with the street then let the friction of your deck against the concrete be enough to slow your momentum let's try stopping with the tail with moderate speed the important part of this maneuver is to shift most of your body weight to the tail remember the more pressure you have on your tail the faster you're going to slow down another way of slowing down is to take your pushing foot and drag it across the ground while this needs more balance	val_2	8402

v_i2X7z9ywHV8	After the smoke clears,he begins talking excessively and making several hand motions	29.79	60.55	192.22	11.0	often used to impress people now the idea is pretty simple you draw smoke into your lungs you allow a little bit out to fill your mouth and then you puff just like that like just just clicking your soft palate a little bit and puffing out little bits of air and the idea is that forces out a little bit of smoke which forms into a ring and goes away from you see if I can do this on camera	val_2	8619
v_i2X7z9ywHV8	When he removes his hand from his throat,he takes another puff of the hookah and blows it out again	60.55	105.72	192.22	11.0	that's it I mean those are rings that that's how you do it there's another way to do it that I'm really not good at called Cheerios where you create a tiny little Oh with your lips and then tap on the side of your mouth or on the side of your cheek I'm really not good at that if you want the cheat code though the cheat code is any kind of tube like this this is just the top of a plastic vodka bottle actually yeah classy that I cut off and now the idea is that you fill it with smoke similar to how I filled my cheeks with smoke and puff through in the same way and that very very easily creates rings you can do this with a paper towel tube or something or	val_2	8620

Janina and i'm gonna put a link somewhere up around here for my glaucoma video but those of you who see me on a mobile device are probably not going to see that notation or that week so please try to find that link and learn about glaucoma if you have any questions and until then drink up don't think so much	val_2	9265

v_D2TQ_RR2Q50	More clips are shown of people running a marathon while others still speak to the camera	62.25	153.93	226.37	13.0	yourself in that moment you accomplished something and there's always another race if you want to get back out there yeah and going off of what Molly said emotions are high at the finish line it's really easy to skip the cooldown which is one of the worst mistakes I think you can make take ten minutes to stretch walk around you will be so happy you did this the next day when you wake up and it's true resist the urge to curl up in a little ball so you know enjoy this celebratory atmosphere don't beat yourself up but make sure and do your full-time yes now August you're gonna be faced with some food options at the end perhaps some of your friends have brought you some stuff or there's gonna be stuff at the finish line what should you choose to eat after a race like this it's important to eat after your race if you run a half marathon you've probably burned upwards 1500 calories you're looking for something with a good amount of proteins and a good amount of carbs that's gonna help fight off muscle soreness I particularly like the nut butter sandwiches with banana and a side of chocolate milk so you may have a pit meal I do I do but it works it that's right and on the more adult side of things I am a big proponent of rewarding yourself a lot of races have beer gardens at the end so I think it's fun to enjoy a little post race beer it's got carbs it's got calories it's a great way to celebrate with fellow runners but definitely keep in mind you are on an empty stomach and there's a lot of adrenaline so it will hit you pretty fast moderation go slow ease into it also ease back into foods like maybe fried foods or candy or whatever it is you may be gave up right before the race don't just like right on face so don't chug like four beers I need an entire cake probably up chug water okay you can't chug on just make sure	val_2	9455
v_D2TQ_RR2Q50	The women continue speaking while others still run around	155.06	220.71	226.37	13.0	water okay you can't chug on just make sure you're totally hydrated now the muscles that's gonna be a big piece of all this you're just fatigued and then you put them through the wringer what should you do to alleviate that yeah muscle soreness is huge in any sort of long exercise activity if you can treat yourself to a nice massage it helps with lactic acid buildup it sites muscle fatigue and if you're like me and you are really sore you get a lot of inflammation ice you know 20 minutes on the effective area affected area on and off all day long really gonna help it's important also in the days after marathon as your muscles start to feel better not to immediately put yourself to get back out there I know the urge will be there but keep it light go for a little really light run or swim or bike or try something else because you hear too many stories about runners getting back out there too fast and that's when they get injured and that's not what you want to happen ya know after you can all get across the finish line you certainly don't want to you know harm yourself after the race now you guys have finished it was it worth it would you do it again I think yeah I would absolutely do it again yeah I'll get back up okay well with these post race tips you'll be ready to do it thanks so much guys and congratulations	val_2	9456

v_CvsFEsXakwo	The angle of the camera changes and then the guy starts to talk about the high hat	14.86	58.51	185.76	13.0	just learning how to play the drums and basically where you want to start with the surfaces that you want to play eighth notes on the hi-hat which are counted as one and two and three and four and you will play beats one and three of the measure on the bass drum on one and two three and four and and there will be sort of a call and answer effect with the snare drum which falls on beats two and four one and two and three and four and the hi-hat part will sound something like this one and two and three and four and now notice I played accents on my down beats on the one two three four and this is something	val_2	10106

v_CvsFEsXakwo	He then continues the rest of the video in the same manner,with the bass drum following before finally playing the entire trap set	130.03	185.76	185.76	13.0	entire rhythm sounds like this one two ready one last thing you may want to try to develop is the same rhythm played off the ride cymbal where you would move your right hand or your hi-hat hand to the ride and perhaps even play quarter notes or some sort of note value along with the groove that you're playing so what I'll do now is play the same groove off the ride and play quarter notes on one two three four with my hi-hat one two three so although there are many different variations of rock rhythms and this is just the beginning this is a great place to start to understand grooving	val_2	10108

v_rXwSSTGmvb8	man is mixing a drink in a cocktail shaker and talking to the camera showing how to prepare it	18.14	139.04	201.5	13.0	about amaretto is the classic amaretto sour three simple ingredients it's a fantastic cocktail to make for any occasion so we have a amaretto of course we're using amaretto d Serrano which is an almond flavored liqueur we have fresh citrus and of course our simple syrup now easy cocktail let's get started we're going to build this cocktail in a mixing glass I always recommend a mixing glass to build your cocktail before you add ice the reason is is as you build it if you get pulled away for a moment you can come back and you haven't watered down your cocktail so let's start with one and a half ounces of amaretto and I'm using a jigger today just to make sure we have all our portions on point which if you don't have that available you can always count it out which is going to be one second for every quarter ounce of liqueur poured so of course that's relative to how fast or slow you count but that's the idea so next we're going to do 3/4 simple syrup which is a 60-40 sugar water blend and the key to this simple syrup is we're about to add citrus we need to balance this cocktail so now we're going to add 3/4 an ounce of citrus which is going to be lemon juice in this case we're gonna use a fresh lemon we're use our citrus juicer and we're going to juice right into our jigger there we go so as you notice it's about maybe two eighths of an inch from the top that's three quarters of an ounce considering this is a 1 ounce jigger so once we add that now we have equal parts of sugar and citrus which now should play out balance and compliment the amaretto that we're using so next let's add our ice I'm just going to add some ice into our glass so you can see the build we're going to flip it and we're going to get ready do I shake now here's the key we're not going to strain this we're	val_2	10258

v_UH9qJ4Y6ENA	We are concentrated on these two for the duration	65.42	141.75	198.25	11.0	first then you go into a lunge and that's like the basic attack I mean there's like special pants like called knickers that and a special jacket that are both made of like a thicker material just to protect you there's also like a mass that will protect your face but there's also like electric equipment like there's a wire that runs through your body and runs through the sporting equipment that'll like help keep score the sword is like a wired blade it's like in the triangular shape and it's pretty flexible actually like a lot of fencing actually includes like flicking and stuff like that so it's not like a straight attack all the time as for shoes like a lot of times people use volleyball shoes wrestling shoes anything with like a really flat sole and not a big arch is like optimal for fencing because you got like a better feel of the floor the way happened the way that FA works it's called the dueling weapon because the entire body is target and you hit your opponent with the skip at the tip of the blade and other weapons you hit with a side but in this weapon you have at the tip coming into this first direct elimination doubt I didn't know my opponent and so I made sure to not take him lightly that wouldn't know I don't know what what style of my thing he does and so I just took it slow at the beginning until I found out his weaknesses and then exploited those to win 15 to 9	val_2	10390

v_U5wliityRuU	The instructor is seen talking to the camera	27.61	90.72	197.21	4.0	traditional recreational flutter kick now before we can start with propulsion we need to think a little bit more than our basic platform in the water what we're looking at is just try and get a nice solid body position where our shoulders and our knees are the same depth nice and flat with our head tilted upwards our knees bent upwards our arms can come forwards to give us more stability as well this is what we call our basic trim position once we have our basic trim position with everything nicely balanced then we can start looking at our propulsion techniques we have two techniques that we're going to look at in this video the first one we call the frog kick so now we can see the diver on screen demonstrating towards the Frog kick we can see that he's in a good trim position his knees and his shoulders or the same depth his feet are lifted his head his back of his arms are forward to give him that stability in order to make a frog kick he separates his feet and twists his ankles brings	val_2	10418
v_U5wliityRuU	We go back under water, watching the scuba diver while the instructor talks	96.63	197.21	197.21	4.0	his feet back together again almost making a clapping motion with his fins he slightly extends his legs as he claps the fins together we can then see that he glides for a while this is one of the nice things about the fall kick that we get a kick and then a glide phase this makes it very efficient the second kick that we're going to look at is a modification of the traditional flutter kick what we do is we start in our trimming position nicely flat shoulders two knees with our knees bent once we're in this position we move our lower legs forwards and backwards we're trying to keep our thighs or upper legs stationary at this point try not to move the knees very much we are also keeping our ankles nice and floppy so that the fins can catch the water and propel the water backwards this gives us a nice solid power kick really useful if we need to work against account or if we need to put on a burst of speed at some point during the dock hopefully you found this little introduction to pinning techniques useful if you'd like more information please feel free to visit the gue UK Facebook page ww facebook.com forward slash groups forward slash gue UK I will also be putting some more videos together for sport diver TV looking at the more advanced techniques that we use within gue diving thank you for taking the time to watch this video this is John Kendall from gue UK	val_2	10419

v_ToLMOwlrgm0	She clips her hair back and brushes her bangs	91.9	214.43	218.8	13.0	soft and it's really elongated depending on what kind of style hair you have so I usually just get a handful like this big not a whole lot because you want the boar bristles to go through there all the way to the other side otherwise your hair won't be brushed really well great you really want to get the brush to the ends hm-hmm cuz the ends were really what don't get enough attention and that's what we're trying to do is bring our natural oils to the ends of our hair and that's the greatest elixir in the world if I was detangling then I would start at the ends but my hair is actually fine so if your hair is tangled don't start from the root go to the tip otherwise we'll just break a lot of hair yeah the oil really is very beneficial and just keep adding in things that would be perfect to add into each section cause you're doing it mm-hmm exactly thankfully with an off-day leave it in all night I get a really nice oil treatment yeah I just leave it in mm-hmm and show us how you put the oils like where do you put the oil in I put the oil in as I'm doing sections and I start at the root in the name with your fingers just yeah the brush works well too because it's like it'll stay on the brush so why are you rushing other portions of your hair it just gets easier how's that brush feel it feels amazing I feel good I usually don't use brushes this soft and it's not like breaking any of my hair at all yeah so we really don't want to do any breakage so this one is the best natural boar bristle hundred percent pure boar bristle brush if I encounter any tangles I use my fingers I don't brush it out so the main goal here is basically to brush it down to the ends and put the oil in from the hairline mm-hmm just massage the oil into the ends and then to leave the oil in for a treatment	val_2	10761

v_LsK452h29ng	A young adult male is sitting in a gym on an elliptical machine talking	0.0	61.62	164.32999999999998	4.0	hi this is how to use a rowing machine and this is one of those machines that seems to be sort of a mystery and a lot of gyms that I go into um I see people using them improperly all the time so just little brash course lesson in the best way and the most effective way to use a rower and also keep in mind preventing injury on this machine okay first of all you see I'm sitting it on the rower I'll let you figure that part out for yourself you want to grab the handles after you've adjusted your settings the attention setting is just on the side of the rover here depending on the rower you can use whatever grip you'd like underhand or overhand this gives you more of a bicep pull here you've got the same thing here but you're using more of your back without your biceps helping all right something else keep in mind on Rory its posture	val_2	11008
v_LsK452h29ng	After the introduction,he grabs the bar,while his feet are placed solidly in the straps and begins moving it back and forth in sort of a rowing position	60.8	119.96	164.32999999999998	4.0	your biceps helping all right something else keep in mind on Rory its posture this is the most common mistake that I see people making they're usually hunching so when they come here they're like this okay and what you've got there is a possible risk to shoulders neck and traps lower back all kinds of things you put at risk when you're slouching like that okay so what I tell people to do as a queue is to make sure when you row back that you row into your sternum make sure you keep that row up at that level so you're going straight back right into your sternum or solar places now you're flying areal higher depends on what you're trying to work because this machine is multi-purpose yeah you've got some great pull action going on for your upper body all right now what you want to keep in mind is to make sure when you come back that the pull on your upper body is the last thing that you do another thing I see people doing is pulling here before they even get back	val_2	11009
v_LsK452h29ng	However,throughout the entire process the guy never stops talking and giving tips and technique about the proper way to use the machine	120.78	164.33	164.32999999999998	4.0	pulling here before they even get back here okay so here there and what you got here is a stretch on the hamstrings use that torque help pullback in the upper body okay so let's see it in real time full speed you want to exhale out on the pull rowing is one of my favorite cardiovascular workouts and if you do it right you get some great results out of that's how to use wrong machine	val_2	11010

v__MR8G1jwM4o	a woman then demonstrates the exercise machine	133.02	201.55	201.55	4.0	between your arms and your legs you can work hard but not feel like you're observing yourself as much as you truly are many first-time users are surprised at their elevated heart rate and calorie burn compared to their perceived effort in addition to these benefits the elliptical provides you with the opportunity to get multiple workouts on one machine changing the stride length reversing the leg motions pushing or pulling the arms these are just some of the variables that create a new and different workout each time you get on the elliptical cross trainer plan your own interval workout or try one of the pre-programmed workouts and let the Machine be your personal trainer and of course the key to anything you have in your home is how it adapts to your environment the elliptical cross trainer is typically space efficient and it's made to be smooth and quiet when you are exercising so you can hear what's going on around you like your phone like your kids or your TV so try out an elliptical cross trainer and experience the benefits of a high-intensity low-impact workout that meets the needs of almost any exerciser	val_2	11294

v_NsqW8ZwYDEk	After several releases of the boy,the target is zoomed in on and the guy comes back to talk about what just took place	150.82	187.35	187.35	13.0	can see how your muscles will start to break down and how the the point of impact starts to move and and then your accuracy is is not there key to being a good archer the key to being a good shot being a successful hunter is to shoot your bow and practice often practice as often as you can doesn't have to be a lot it can be 10 to 20 errors two or three times a week you want to maintain muscle memory keep these few hunting tips in mind and we'll have you pumping blood I'm Dave letting Dave lead you and that's your archery tip of the week you	val_2	11470

v_J4rzLO4u_pI	He puts on a pair of gloves	25.86	60.6	147.8	13.0	structure in the garden this time of year so I usually hold off and I cut them back sometime in early February so we're just about there and just about time to go ahead and cut them back so today we're going to go ahead and demonstrate how to do that few little tips to make it a little bit easier on yourself these ornamental grasses are very sharp and so if you're cutting them back and you're not wearing gloves and you have short sleeves you're going to end up cutting yourself so I always wear long sleeves when I'm cutting these back and I also have my trusty gloves with me that's very helpful especially when you're going to be cutting a bunch of them back alright so we're going to go	val_2	12046
v_J4rzLO4u_pI	He then uses shears to cut the dry dead grass in front of the house	79.07	147.8	147.8	13.0	want to do this before new growth resumes on the spring because if you wait until the new growth starts you'll be then cutting back the new growth that's coming up and you end up getting them off on mohawk haircut so we don't want to do that so we cut these back and one of the other things that I do is in the garden here is I always have a tarp with me because these grasses are real messy so I have a tarp close by put it in the tarp as you can see how easy this is one of the other things that is very helpful is to use your body to push the grasses back and it's easier to cut them then grab handfuls Panthers at a time and that also helps with the process so now quickly this goes and here you go few minutes and this grass is ready for spring	val_2	12047

Douglas came home advanced pain management good morning to you good morning are you I'm great well getting a little snow down here but let's first talk about there's two different aspects we want to discuss and first is the proper equipment absolutely you know we can really break proper shoveling down into two categories first of all proper equipment second of all proper technique so as far as equipment goes I have two two examples here this is a very short shovel as you can see it's a portable shovel normally used for digging your power out in bitch if you're so unfortunate the handle telescope exactly the handle does telescope but not really long enough to prevent stooping when you are when you're shoveling and so that may be a challenge or you're trying to get through your whole driveway this however is a much better tool before getting that bigger job done because it is going to reduce tubing and give you better leverage and reduce the strain on your back so you want to make sure that you have a long enough handle now let's talk and can you describe to us a proper technique it sounds silly because you think how many different ways are there to shovel but can you tell us what is the best way to avoid that lower back pain of course there are a couple of things that you can do first of all we don't really think about snow shoveling is exercise like we would if we would go to the gym however it is pretty strange this exercise so getting a little bit of a warm-up in sand gentle stretches even going for a brief walk is a good way so kind of warm up your muscles for appropriate snow shoveling secondly is technique lifting with your legs trying to keep your feet approximately hip width apart and keeping a straight back at all possible and lifting with your legs now what about some people favor one side over another does that make any difference you know it does actually switching sides can help to reduce the strain on one side in particular alright also I there's a lot to be said for having good exercise year-round so you're ready for this kind of thing absolutely all right thank you so much and we'll take a look at what we can do here in the parking lot you bet for more information you can always check out advanced pain management website at ATM health com and will provide a link for that on our web channel NBC 15.com thanks so much	val_2	12171

v_DepG0r3JiV4	He puts the racket closer to the camera	54.39	74.93	76.07	13.0	looks something like that key thing to look for is a slight gap between the base of your thumb and your middle finger if your finger touches the base of your thumb the grip is too small if you have too big a gap the grip is too big so something like that is ideal	val_2	12216

v_p8MvTi8hJdE	The man demonstrates how to move on the board while still speaking to the camera	54.99	159.46	219.94	13.0	and then I'm stopping go back up stand on your board flat get off your board stop the trick to keeping stable on your snowboard is to make sure that your shoulders stay above your board if you lean forward too much you'll fall forward if you lean back too much you try to stick out two feet in front of your shoulders you fall backwards so now what we're going to do instead of stepping off to stop I want you to continue moving forward over do a j-turn towards our heel side so I'm going to be moving forward and I'm going to be applying pressure on my back heel and what that does is it will cause my feel edge to initiate the turn and I'm going to move my upper body in the direction that I want to turn so right now I'm facing sideways and I want to turn to my heel side I just spread my shoulders where's my back and it will initiate the turn as well under my feet okay body forward and that caused me to do is he'll break you can go a little bit farther pick up a little bit more speed you want to feel stable on your board I'm gonna straight forward slide fester on my heel side to do the break okay so you practice that several times I'd spend about ten minutes first up her edge this time we're gonna turn again travel down straight flat bottom keeping our shoulders above the snowboard I'm gonna turn my shoulders towards the back and I'm going to apply pressure on my toe edge blacks on our boards go there's	val_2	12218

v_lfH_S2LTEXA	A bearded man is inside a gym	0.0	37.11	218.29	4.0	so when you're climbing there's two easy ways to classify almost all the motion static motion and dynamic motion the critical difference being static motion is slow typically more fluid very controlled in a dynamic motion often involves more power more momentum it's kind of the speed at which you're doing these moves a dynamic move you're going to be moving from balance through a position of unbalance to another position of balance kind of tossing your body a little bit moving with momentum	val_2	12418
v_lfH_S2LTEXA	He climbs a fake rock wall, jumping onto the rocks on the ceiling	38.2	118.97	218.29	4.0	body a little bit moving with momentum in a static move you'll be controlled the whole time always moving while your body is within balance kind of allowing you to almost undo that move the same way you would do it how you know when you need to use a static move or a dynamic move depends certainly on what type of climbing you're doing where the hand holds are the size of the hand holds lots of variables one important one being where your center of gravity is you'll need to use a dynamic move if you have to move your center of gravity outside your base of support meaning you might be reaching beyond where your feet are maybe the handhold is too far for you to get to by just pulling up and keeping your body in that position you need a little bit more momentum to move that center of gravity outside all the points of contact you have with the wall which is known as your base of support so a couple examples of static and dynamic motion can be demonstrated here on this 45-degree overhanging wall so to show you some static motion I'll demonstrate some moves on this particular climb you'll notice while I'm climbing my body is moving very slow very controlled my feet are staying on the wall the whole time and I'm always balanced I'm never doing a move where I	val_2	12419
v_lfH_S2LTEXA	He continues to hold on, shown talking with the camera as others do the same	120.06	218.29	218.29	4.0	balanced I'm never doing a move where I need to swing or generate any momentum I can pull my body up hold it in position and grab the next hold so each time the appendage that I'm moving is completely unweighted and I can move it very intentionally very slowly and with a lot of control and precision that would be an example of static motion to do the same climb dynamically I'll be using more momentum moving my body much quicker using more power and potentially skipping holds climbing it very differently allowing my feet to come off the wall and putting them back on so that would be an example of dynamic motion it allows you to cover a bit more ground with each move but you're really recruiting some more muscles using a lot of force and a lot of power to generate all that momentum and move dynamically from one position to another and that's the basic difference between static and dynamic motion	val_2	12420

v_eZbdiuUu0S8	Wolf Wigo then gives his own tips about water polo	65.85	80.38	193.68	0.0	go has swum a a lot of high-level meets Wolff do you love the race swimming yeah there's something really competitive about just getting up on the block's and going after it and that's that's really what I love about swimming the most not necessarily all the training but really putting yourself in a position to be competitive and then getting after it once you get to a meet the next big misnomer is that water polo	val_2	12544
v_eZbdiuUu0S8	Brad returns to talking about swimming while Wolf watches	80.38	164.63	193.68	0.0	getting after it once you get to a meet the next big misnomer is that water polo can really mess up your swim stroke okay another misnomer number one you're in the water you may be working on you know some smaller movements a tighter stroke but you're working different tighter muscles which makes you a better swimmer okay the argument that if I play water polo then I can't swim fast and just really if you think about it it doesn't make sense I personally made all my NC 2a cuts right after water polo season the only swimming that I was doing was sprints lots of Sprint's at the end of every training now of course everybody can't combine both sports at the highest level but I think on a whole swimmers and water polo players from the same mold and they love the water and that's the most important thing so coaches out there swim coaches water polo coaches we're not enemies we're on the same team share the sport of water pool with swimmers share the sport of swimming with the water polo players but keep it appropriate for the water polo players keep it short and fast challenge them put them in racing situations that's why they love the water so much they've developed and found the ball in the water couldn't	val_2	12545
v_eZbdiuUu0S8	Wolf then talks again, affirming what Brad said	164.63	185.93	193.68	0.0	water so much they've developed and found the ball in the water couldn't agree more with what Brett what Brad's saying and it's all about having fun staying fresh and you know working on new things and in each sport you can have parallels in the training but really it's all about having a good time and getting a good workout in and trying to push yourself and improve yourself to be the best you can be in whatever you're working on at the top	val_2	12546

v_ItukN-TWrJM	She shows off scissors and colored pink ribbon	20.31	47.38	150.41	13.0	you're going to need a nice sharp pair of scissors very important what you want to do is when you start with your ribbon you're going to place it onto the bottom of your box making sure there aren't any twists along the bottom like so and in order to make sure that you have just enough ribbon you when you lay it across the top you want to have just a little bit of length for tying and for trimming off in case your ends aren't even or in case maybe they're just a little bit crooked okay so here I'm going to start	val_2	12839
v_ItukN-TWrJM	She then shows how to wrap the ribbon and tie a bow around a present	49.63	150.41	150.41	13.0	crooked okay so here I'm going to start by using the left side of the ribbon and I'm going to go from the top and around to the bottom and the trick with tying a good square knot or ribbon around your box is making sure that your initial knot is nice and tight up against your box so you're gonna place a couple of fingers there like so just to keep everything in place or if you have a friend who always wants to offer that finger to help you keep everything down go ahead and take them up on that offer so right there I have my knot nice and nice and snug and I'm going to take the top of my ribbon and without any extra twists in it it's going to be nice and flat and I'm going to bring it over to the bottom and take my bottom ribbon over the top and through like so and if you notice my finger is still on that first initial knot and we're going to maybe switch hands to help me tie and then you tug and then from here you just want to flatten your square knot so it's nice and flat like that and then if you want you can trim it up just enough I like to have them just to the edges of the box so I'm going to maybe take off a couple just maybe an inch or so so I'm going to hold onto my ends like this because I like to have them symmetrical cut on a slight angle like so and there you go classic square dot Thanks	val_2	12840

v_4sm-tTbfamM	He spins the tires and adjusts the chain	39.24	127.76	182.51	4.0	too little then when I go to shift to the highest gear another Norg so if I adjust it too little then when I go to the hot from a low gear to the high gear it has the potential to fall off which this one it's not doing at all area um so if I just if I just improperly and I go from the smallest gear to the highest gear then has the potential of falling all the way off it's going to make sure that that is adjusted properly so it will prevent it from doing that okay now that your lowest gear here the largest cog is the limit screw is adjusted you want to adjust your B screw so basically what that is is this pushing against your derailleur hanger it basically sits right on the derailleur hanger and pushes your derailleur like that basically so the purpose of this is that you can put different size different sized cogs according to whatever the manufacturer specifications are so to adjust the B screw you're just using a Philips head and you tighten it to make your generally go out like that loosen it to go down and basically what you want to have is from this jockey wheel right here which is this small little plastic cog should be about two mil two to three millimeters away from the teeth of the largest cog or the lowest gear so if your B screw is too tight basically it's going to have your jockey wheel	val_2	12845
v_4sm-tTbfamM	He continues tightening the chair using metal tools	135.06	182.51	182.51	4.0	it's looking like right here now if it's too loose what's going to happen is the jockey wheel is going to these metal I'm sure these plastic teeth here are going to hit against the metal teeth and make a lot of sound and it's also not going to shift as well so when you're adjusting the screw you want to make sure that your jockey wheel teeth are the proper specification away from the largest cog here the teeth so they're not hitting and also not so not too far apart most manufacturers tell you it's usually around two to three millimeters between the plastic teeth and the metal teeth so that's how to adjust your derailers and keep your chain running smoothly	val_2	12846

v_RjBXzs2XvbY	a man is standing holding a knife over a table	0.0	42.86	225.57999999999998	13.0	now I'm going to explain how to sharpen a traditional Japanese knife these are handmade values this one I have here is a Yanagi knife to use for slicing sashimi crudo we could do thin slices of meat with it as well so when sharpening these knives there's several bevels actually on this knife you have the main primary edge here which is called the hasaki you have the tip of the kissaki and then you have the harder carbon is on the edge as well and then some softer cladding in here so I want to start sharpening these knives from the shinobi line down so I'll start with a 1,000 grit stone and instead of my fingers being tore to the edge here it's going	val_2	12943
v_RjBXzs2XvbY	the man points to several parts of the knife	60.91	166.93	225.57999999999998	13.0	like so for the tip of the knife never touches the stone fully so you need to raise your elbow up a little bit and put the knife sort into the stone a little bit so Fe you sharpen the length of the blade and again we're just sharpening from the shinobi to line down until right above the edge so we're not actually sharp in the edges yet we're going to sharpen the shinobi line first and then when we're ready to sharpen the edge we're going to lower off fingers a little bit and you're naturally going to form a burr on the night and once you accomplish that throughout the whole length of the blade you're going to turn the knife over and do you know she sharpening and that sharpening the back side of the knife these are concave in the middle here so what we're trying to focus on is this line from the spine and the heel as just a few millimeters here so the knife is placed flat on the stone and again you're just working down the length of the lathe here this will remove any burrs on the night and I'll even out these two sides as well on the knife so after the 1911 the should know going down to just about the edge so my finger placement is right in the middle here	val_2	12944
v_RjBXzs2XvbY	the man then demonstrates the knife's ability	155.65	225.58	225.57999999999998	13.0	and I'll even out these two sides as well on the knife so after the 1911 the should know going down to just about the edge so my finger placement is right in the middle here and then for the tip again we're going to raise up a little bit just to get that tip barrier there and then continue on down the length of the blade this is just going to refine that burr and now I'm going to do the edge I think is very close to the edge here trying to try to avoid going solo where you might cut yourself just above the edge now we're just going to turn the knife over and do your grocery shopping that's the basic of sharpening the Japanese in our connect	val_2	12945

v_Ue90f5r-2Qw	He is holding a violin and string in his hands	31.31	107.22	156.53	14.0	dividing a string into various fractions for example if I want to play a G above my open G I'll put down my fourth finger in fourth position that will put me at half the string so I'm dividing a string in half play lightly don't press hard with your left hand and allow the string your resonate if you notice I can even lift my finger and it continues to play that octave D or a a or whatever it doesn't matter so now that's an octave above each and every string you achieve that in the fourth finger fourth position or any finger you want on the exact same spot if you want to go up two octaves you achieve that by using your third finger in first position easiest that would put you at a quarter of the string and it'll shoot up two octaves so if i play the g that's one octave here's another octave now the second octave is by using the third finger same thing in each and every string now we have one octave and we have two octaves if you use your fourth finger these are the easiest harmonics by the way there are a lots of harmonics but if you use your fourth finger you'll get an octave plus a fifth and it'll sound like this so	val_2	13178
v_Ue90f5r-2Qw	He talks about how to play it and a harmonica	111.13	156.53	156.53	14.0	those are the three simplest harmonics there's another harmonic which you achieve by using a solid finger and a loose finger so the solid finger gives you the bass and the loose finger barely touching the string will give you the harmonic and we call these finger two harmonics and you can use this to play just about any note that you can imagine here's an example of fingered harmonics on the g string the vibrato works on fingered off harmonics because both your solid note and your fourth thing are moving at the same time so that's my lesson on harmonics I hope you use them wisely thank you for visiting Villeurbanne com	val_2	13179

v_Y9B22Ii7-eE	A man is standing behind a table	7.24	196.46	206.8	15.0	happy world that day yes its world that day and my name is Howard Helmer and I'm the world's fastest omelet maker yes I am you'll find me in the Guinness Record Book for having made 427 omelets in 30 minutes but today I'm going to demonstrate how to make an omelet in a minute and here is the technique that I use for world dead day then we're going to spread into omelets with fillings that are typical of the countries that the omelet is named for I'm going to do spinach cheddar cheese and bacon here goes I've got a 10 inch frying pan I use a 10 inch frying pan and I liked some chefs use an 8 inch or a 7 inch frying pan I like to use a 10 inch pan for two reasons one because there's more cooking surface the omelette gets done more quickly and second when I turn it out onto the plate I have a more generous looking product I have everything ready in advance my recipe for each omelet is 2 eggs and 2 tablespoons of water I've made a mother lode of eggs here and I'm using a standard kitchen soup ladle which universally in the US is 4 ounces which is exactly 2 eggs and 2 tablespoons of water what a break so I'm going to ladle all of my prepared egg into the pan and work it from there so let me get everything ready here I'm all set into the pan I'm going to put a pad of butter then a ladle full of egg on top of it then with the spatula move the cooked egg from the perimeter of the pan to the center while moving the pan around so that the whole bottom of the pan stays covered with egg and this procedure should take about 20 seconds and then I'm ready to fill the Goblet so into my hot pan goes to pee out of butter two eggs and two tablespoons of water the pan should be hot enough so that the water so that the egg bubbles up right away from the outside of the pan I draw the egg to the center dig a hole fill it up take a hole fill it up always making sure that the bottom of the pen is completely covered with the egg so I end up with an egg pancake and I do that till the egg is not running anymore but it's still very wet on top here goes my cheddar cheese my bacon and I've got chiffonade spinach this is raw spinach that I've cut in ribbons fold the omelet in half then the whole thing goes upside down on a plate and as simple as this looks as as simple as it is and at the fine hotel where I'm staying they get 12.95 for this omelet 1350	val_2	13234

v_IgyBIt3GTAU	The man then takes a small can of wax and puts it on a piece of wood that he is holding in his hand	21.34	138.73	194.03	13.0	to life one of the first things we do once we bring a piece in usually from an outdoor market or another antique shop wipe it down and we use a special furniture wax it's a European furniture wax that comes in different colors what I've done here is here's an example of a piece of furniture and this was the original finish you can see it's very dusty and dull it's even got some paint marks on it what I did is I just took some very simple 40 steel wool and that's four zeros you don't want it to be too harsh otherwise you'll ruin the finish and then some of the furniture wax that we have it's got a bee's what it's a beeswax compound and it comes in different colors so even if you have some gouges or scratches you try to pick a color that matches your piece best and it blends it right in the bottom part here is an example something that we did in a darker finish the darker oak up here is a golden oak and here's the original so you can see you don't have to refinish a piece necessarily when you buy it to bring back its original patina for ongoing maintenance you should apply wax every three to four months or as needed it will help your would last longer things you also need to consider our never spray any aerosol cleaners directly on a finish this will over time eat away at the finish and cause permanent damage what you want to do is take a rag and spray it directly into the rag and then wipe it on to your furniture to keep that shine the other things you need to consider is what is your climate if you're in New York City for example where you have very humid summers and very cold winters where a lot of the heat is steam heat it pulls all the moisture out of the air and that can do tremendous damage to wood furniture so you want to make sure that you have a humidifier going and during the summer months if it is very humid you can also use a dehumidifier in places like Arizona the same thing extreme heat can cause damage to wood furniture one thing we've	val_2	13442
v_IgyBIt3GTAU	After dabbing the wax with a white rag,he begins running his fingers over the wood and showing other pieces of wood that the product has been used on	137.76	194.03	194.03	13.0	same thing extreme heat can cause damage to wood furniture one thing we've probably all experienced is sticking drawers and it can be very frustrating but there are some easy remedies one is if you've just bought a piece of furniture out and say a flea market that might have been very damp and it might have been out there for a few days just let the piece dry out for a little bit maybe one or two weeks to make sure if the drawer is still sticking if it's a slight stick you can use a bar of soap it's as simple as that however more serious sticks might require some sanding and usually if you remove a drawer you'll be able to see where the where is on the side of the drawer if you take some sandpaper which you can get at any hardware store and just start sanding that area and that should solve your problem and then repeat the process until the sticking has stopped these are all very easy and inexpensive solutions that you can do at home so thanks for watching and to learn more visit us on the web at home garden dot-com	val_2	13443

v_bOUtD3leN0E	She puts another curler behind the first one	175.9	208.18	222.66	13.0	can put it under on the bottom of the roller which again for sitting under a dryer may get hot or another thing that you can do secure it to the next roller behind it so you've got two rollers in here and what I'm doing tilt your head down for me I'm taking this and I'm just securing it with those two rollers one in front of the back securing it like that and what that's gonna do is that's gonna keep both rollers right where I put them needless to say the velcro	val_2	13680

v_4ImpZRtbzYw	She then sands down the table and dips a brush into paint	46.2	132.82	192.49	13.0	the table until all the varnish is sanded off then when it sanded give it a quick wipe down and you can start painting we're using house paints are the same kind of thing that you would use on the walls or the ceilings and it's from Wilkinson's and it's in the color twine you just want to paint this on using the appropriate brush size depending on how big your furniture is let the first coat dry and then do another coat if your piece has detail in it like ours does you can do what we're doing we took a small screwdriver and scratched away the paint in the grooves this makes the detail stand out and makes the piece look a bit more antique another thing you can do to make it look older is take some fine sandpaper on the same block you used earlier and just buff off some of the pain on the corners and the edges where the paint would naturally come off through use and when you finish with that brush off any dust that might have fallen then the next thing we do to add a bit of character and protect the furniture is we use furniture wax take an old cloth or a piece of fabric wipe it through the wax and then wipe it onto the surface the next thing we're going to do is cover the top of the table because it's got some damage and what we're going to be using to do this is fab lon also known as sticky back plastic and the first thing we're going to do is measure out the size of the top of the table then cut out a template in paper and check that it fits when you've done that roll out your fab lon and we're just using spice jars to hold down the corners then put your template in the corner and draw around	val_2	13796
v_4ImpZRtbzYw	She then paints all around the table while sanding more and finally laying down wax	84.7	158.81	192.49	13.0	another thing you can do to make it look older is take some fine sandpaper on the same block you used earlier and just buff off some of the pain on the corners and the edges where the paint would naturally come off through use and when you finish with that brush off any dust that might have fallen then the next thing we do to add a bit of character and protect the furniture is we use furniture wax take an old cloth or a piece of fabric wipe it through the wax and then wipe it onto the surface the next thing we're going to do is cover the top of the table because it's got some damage and what we're going to be using to do this is fab lon also known as sticky back plastic and the first thing we're going to do is measure out the size of the top of the table then cut out a template in paper and check that it fits when you've done that roll out your fab lon and we're just using spice jars to hold down the corners then put your template in the corner and draw around it and when you've done that cut it out the way if a blonde works is it has a bit of film on the back and you pull that off and then it's sticky underneath when applying it to the top of the table you want to peel and fold a strip of the film backwards line it up and slowly pull the film from underneath while pressing down the fab lon as you go and when you've pulled out all the film	val_2	13797
v_4ImpZRtbzYw	She measures the table and cuts out paper to put on top and shows off the table in the end her speaking more	155.92	186.72	192.49	13.0	pull the film from underneath while pressing down the fab lon as you go and when you've pulled out all the film wrap it down making sure to guess out any air bubbles and making sure it goes into the corners and the edges and that's it you're done you can always add a piece of glass on the top if you'd like to but that's it it's pretty simple and that's it I hope you liked it and I hope it was easy to follow remember to comment and give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and subscribe if you're not already and you can follow me on all my social networks which are always listed in the description there	val_2	13798

Jennifer Walden a cosmetic surgeon here in Austin to talk about the benefits of sunscreen which go beyond protecting against sunburn thanks for joining us today thank you now you say there was this article in The New York Times that did a study on sunscreen year-round right and basically it was a study out of Australia that looked at 903 men and women under the age of 55 so relatively young half were assigned to use sunscreen regularly outside every couple of hours after being in the water half were told to use it at their own discretion look the researchers took impressions of the left hand before and then after the	val_2	14503

v_rWdXyKZnL2U	He begins to play the violin	18.94	29.54	151.49	14.0	remember because you start on the D without playing any sharps or flats and there you have your D minor going skill so it should sound something like this	val_2	14650
v_rWdXyKZnL2U	He puts the violin down and continues talking	31.81	151.49	151.49	14.0	now for those of you this is a lot of jazz you know that you rarely hear even notes and jets so if you have eighth notes of 16 you have to swing them and swinging is not an exact rhythm but more of a feeling and it differs from person to person but if you take three eighth note triplets for example you tie the first two together that's a good idea of what you're gonna be playing like so dad I got that Bob I got okay if I want to enhance my D minor Dorian scale I can add the ninth to it which would be any natural so the eighth would be the octave which is a D the following note would be your ninth so here comes a D minor 9th Dorian scale there's your ninth right there okay there's a lot of stuff you can do by just playing scales and that's without even touching the arpeggios or or the special effects or the the creativity that's gonna hopefully come out of your mind as you're playing and listening to the music and your your body is taking over but if you familiarize yourself with these scales and every single key you'll be able to do a lot of improvisation right off the bat without having to work on it too long now another great thing to do is to listen to a lot of jazz and try to learn from what other people are doing you pick up a lot just by listening sometimes you don't even realize it but you this and you imitate and then you start to be creative and find your own things to do if you don't already have any Dorian scales to look at you can get them off of my website I have a little link where I have sheet music and on the bottom of that link I have jazz scales arpeggios and studies things that I've written up myself for you and it's it's all there for free just download it and print it and practice it every day in to become very familiar with these scales thank you for visiting fiddler man this is your first lesson on jazz improvisation thank you	val_2	14651

v_2oizmWFx4PA	It is then replaced with a new one	93.9	161.89	161.89	13.0	now this part here is just going to fit right on there like this and screw in now go ahead and take a crescent wrench and screw this in and then periodically I want to go ahead and back off a little bit now this should clean up the the threads in there okay and remove this this part and the threat should be pretty well cleaned up there now I have my crank arm puller here let's go ahead and just try to throw this in see how it does and threads in pretty nicely now very cool	val_2	14846

v_45llr44Pu9g	Several close ups of a bike are shown with a person adjusting the sides with a screwdriver	58.9	155.28	214.18	4.0	located on the backside of the fork or bridge this should be pretty tight but not mega tight now squeeze the caliper together does it return properly if not the spring may be broken and the caliper should be replaced do the barrel adjusters work correctly if your equipments in good shape then move on to pad adjustment now before doing any adjustments to your brakes first you want to make sure your wheels and the dropouts correctly and by correctly I mean make sure it's not crooked finding the right placement for your road brake pads is pretty easy start by loosening the brake pad bolt it will now move freely align the pad on the middle of the rim running even with both edges you can even squeeze the lever together to hold it in position while you tighten the bolt see it's not so hard with your pads in the correct position the right way to align your brakes is to first loosen the caliper bolt Center the caliper by I then tighten the caliper bolt back down now all you have to do to fine tune it on most newer Road calipers at least is just use your hand to twist it into position you want the pads to be evenly spaced on both sides of the rim nice the last step is cable tension start by returning all barrel adjusters to the closed position now release the cable from the caliper by loosening the cable clamp bolt use your hands to squeeze the caliper together against the rim pull the cable tight leaving it in between the clamp gently open the caliper a bit with your hands enough to give the rim plenty of space to spin freely then tighten the cable clamp bolt go ahead give the brake lever a squeeze	val_2	14848
v_45llr44Pu9g	The person continues to check the specs on a bike and ends by laughing and speaking to the camera	127.44	208.83	214.18	4.0	the last step is cable tension start by returning all barrel adjusters to the closed position now release the cable from the caliper by loosening the cable clamp bolt use your hands to squeeze the caliper together against the rim pull the cable tight leaving it in between the clamp gently open the caliper a bit with your hands enough to give the rim plenty of space to spin freely then tighten the cable clamp bolt go ahead give the brake lever a squeeze does the lever pull to where you want it if not fix it with cable tension for example if the lever engages too soon or doesn't go far enough back for your liking then loosen the cable clamp bolt while holding the caliper and open the brake just a little bit more tighten the bolt if the lever goes too far or doesn't engage soon enough then tighten the cable either by opening the barrel adjuster or by loosening the cable clamp bolt closing the caliper by hand then tightening the bolt remember to pull the cable tight before clamping it also you could fine tune the alignment by tightening or loosening the centering adjustment bolt this all tegra brake uses a three millimeter allen wrench some brakes we use a Phillips head screwdriver some brakes won't even have this bolt the final outcome should be enough stopping power to flip you over the bars good luck whoa	val_2	14849

v_Y8-7fr5bv24	He then shows her hair with a french braid in the front and begins to demonstrate how to braid it	68.26	117.99	195.03	13.0	really big sections so that this braid doesn't get lost in her hair you want to see it and just continue this technique all the way past the ear secure it with a bobby pin when you have your two braids connect them by creating a mid ponytail I'm going to use a hook hook into the bottom wrap the elastic around the hair until it's nice and secure now the super easy part I take huge bobby pins and I go from the end and just pin into the base of the ponytail this does not have to be perfect you're just making the shape smaller I want the height to be an imaginary line using the jaw as a diagonal guy it's almost like a messy bun and this can work for tons of	val_2	15338

v_E2yPoqpNVdM	He uses a paintball gun while he talks	14.96	74.21	115.06	4.0	easy if it weren't everybody be able to do it and if you don't have good shooting form you're not gonna be able to hit anything I mean you know paintballs are can be fairly accurate if you give them a chance to be so we're gonna give him a chance standing shooting form is what you're going to use if you're a back player because most of the back bunkers are tall bunkers back here so you have a chance to stand up the events keeping on standing is that when you're standing if somebody starts shooting at you you can slide in play tight if you need to play somebody comes in from the flank you can swing around the bunker like this and still be somewhat protected a lot of players when they get into behind bunkers like this they'll stand with their side facing the opponent and they'll lean forward and shoot like this that's not good for several reasons number one this is way off balance I mean you're standing on your toes doing this and you're not gonna be able to have any sort of balance and number two it's really horrible on the back you don't think about these things until you get back surgery trust me I can't even do that for practice I'll show you the technique	val_2	15342
v_E2yPoqpNVdM	He then is engaged in a game of paintball with other men	90.89	115.06	115.06	4.0	going to be straight you're then going to lean out play tight take a couple shots this works an advantage that you can switch sides very easily and go from left to right of the bunker very quickly plus you can play a little bit loose back here lean out a little bit this way and lean out a little bit this way and you have a lot more mobility back here as long as you're standing up you might as well be mobile you might as well use all the space that you have available to you	val_2	15343
